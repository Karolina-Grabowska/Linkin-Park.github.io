        <h1> Linkin Park </h1>
	<p> Linkin Park, a rock band formed in California in 1996, that changed the genre of nu metal forever. </p>
		
	    <h2> Short biography of the band and their career.</h2>
	    
	    <div class = "info">
	<p>Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).</p>
	</div>
	<div class = "info">
	Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album's singles' heavy airplay on MTV led the singles "One Step Closer", 
	"Crawling" and "In the End" all to chart highly on the Mainstream Rock chart; the latter crossed over to the pop chart. 
		</div>	
		   <div class = "info">
	Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band's success. The band explored experimental sounds on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). 
	By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock acts.</p>

	</br>

	
		<div class = "info">
	<p>The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. </p>
		    </div>
		    
		   <div class = "info">
	<p>The band's fifth album, Living Things (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records. 
	Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, and their seventh album, One More Light (2017), was their first pop-oriented record. </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class = "info">
	<p>Linkin Park went on a hiatus when longtime lead vocalist Bennington died by suicide in July 2017.
	In April 2020, bassist Dave Farrell revealed the band was working on new music. 
	<p>Linkin Park is among the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the world's best-selling music artists, 
		having sold over 100 million records worldwide. </br></br>
		</div>
	    
	<h3>Where did Linkin Park get their name from?</h3>
		<div class = "info">    
	<p>The name of the band originated from a park named after Abraham Lincoln, Lincoln Park, but the band changed their moniker to "Linkin Park" after trying to 
	purchase an internet domain and finding out it was too expensive, and opted for a skewed spelling.</p>
